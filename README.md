# Pathfinder

Pathfinder is my default starting point for all of my builds. This is a work in progress and will be updated as my needs change.

If you see anything in here that can be improved, please help me out and let me know. 

Here's a breakdown of the folder structure used:

##css
	-This is where the compiled css will go. Files here never really get touched.
	-All of the actual code writing will happen in the .scss files, then will be compiled down here using codekit.
##helpers
 	-These are the tools I use to set the defaults for a site.
 	-They're gathered from a few different places, then adjusted to meet my needs.
##img
	-Self explanatory.
##parts
	-These are the building blocks that will be used to build out a site.

#Pathfinder is a combination of many different resources:

##Vanilla
 - Much of this is based on [_Vanilla_](http://github.com/csswizardry/vanilla) by [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry), but my version only contains the base styles that I've needed for my projects so far. 
 
 - I encourage you to check out [Inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css) for a more comprehensive framework.

## The [micro clearfix](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/) & [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) are both from [Nicolas Gallagher.](https://github.com/necolas)

## The elements.html file was taken from the developers at [Q Digital Studio](http://qdigitalstudio.com), who sourced it from [the azbuka project](http://code.google.com/p/azbuka/)and the [bluetrip project](http://bluetrip.org/) and [peter beverloo](http://peter.sh/examples/?/html/meter-progress.html)
